# ## Why Python
# 
# - Python is not the best language at eveything but it is second best of everything. It supports a wide range of tasks and has a decent library of base and community projects.
#     - This is useful. A data science project may include everything from scraping data from the web, analyzing a mixture or text and numerical data, computing features, training a model, creating high-quality graphs, and then hosting a website with your results. 
# - Python is heavily used in industry
# 

# ## Python Versions
# 
# This class uses Python3, the currently developed version of Python, and more specifically Python version 3.6 or above. 
# 
# Python2 has reached "End of Life" meaning it is no longer supported or maintained by the Python Organization. 

# ## Python Resources
# 
# These materials presume prior knowledge of the Python programming language. 
# 
# If you are note yet familiar, here are some entry level materials for learning Python:
# 
# - [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python) is good for a beginner's introduction to the language.
# - [The Official Beginners Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) is supported by the Python organization.
# - [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) is a free collection of Jupyter notebooks that takes you through Python. 
#     - This book is especially good (and specifically designed for) if you have some experience with programming in some other language, and want to quickly run through the specifics of Python.

# ## Getting Un-Stuck
# 
# At some point, you will get stuck. It happens. The internet is your friend. 
# 
# If you get an error, or aren't sure how to proceed, use {your favourite search engine} with specific search terms relating to what you are trying to do. Sometimes this just means searching the error that you got.
# 
# Your are likely to find responses on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - which is basically a forum for programming questions, and a good place to find answers. 

# ## Standard Library

# <div class="alert alert-success"> 
# The Standard Library refers to everything in Python that is part of standard version and install of Python.
# </div>

# <div class="alert alert-info"> 
# The Python 
# <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/library/ class="alert-link">Standard Library</a>
# comes with a lot of basic functionality. 
# </div>

# Part of what makes Python a powerful language is the standard library itself, which is a rich set of tools for programming. However, the standard library itself does not include data science tools, and a lot of the power of Python stems for a rich ecosystem of packages that can be added and used with Python. 

# ## Packages

# <div class="alert alert-success"> 
# Packages are collections of code. Packages from outside the standard library can be installed and added to Python.
# </div>
# 
# <div class="alert alert-info"> 
# For managing and installing packages, Anaconda comes with the 
# <a href="https://conda.io/docs/using/pkgs.html" class="alert-link">conda</a>
# package manager.
# </div>

# ## Scientific Python
# 
# When we say that Python is good for data science, and scientific computing, what we really mean is that there is a rich ecosystem of available open-source external packages, that greatly expand the capacities of the language beyond the standard library. 
# 
# This set of packages, which we will introduce as we go through these materials, is sometimes referred to as 'Scientific Python', or the 'Scipy' ecosystem. 
# 
# For the purposes of these materials, the Anaconda distribution that we are using contains all the packages you need. 

# ## Environments

# <div class="alert alert-success">
# Environments are isolated, independent installations of a programming language and groups of packages, that don't interfere with each other.
